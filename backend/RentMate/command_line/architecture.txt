The workflow should go like this:

    inputs = path to CSV
    
    Check CSV for DB constraints
    1) Read from Sample CSV, CSV needs to follow database normalization rules.
    1NF, 2NF, 3NF before we start creating sorting by column and rows.
    We need to check to make sure that the CSV follows these rules before we dump 
    them into the database (in our case AWS).

    Check for CSV constraints
    2) We need to check constraints on how the CSV should be setup, there
    should be a particular set of rules that a CSV should follow for us to process

    Map information to models
    3) We should sort these values out by Product, but also what type of rentals are they doing?
    
    Create serveral classes for custom error handling and to let the user know progress
    of load
